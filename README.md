# HTML_tutorial_apnaclg

This repository contains my daily practice work while learning **HTML**, mainly following the **Apna College Web Development Course**.

## 📅 Purpose
I’m uploading one HTML file each day to:

- Track my progress
- Show consistent contributions on GitHub
- Build a strong foundation in front-end development

## 📁 Folder Contents
Each file represents a different HTML concept I’ve practiced, including:

- HTML tags and structure
- Headings, paragraphs, and text formatting
- Links, images, and anchor tags
- Lists, tables, forms, and input elements
- Semantic elements and basic layouts

## 🚀 Learning Journey
This is not a finished website, but a collection of my step-by-step practice while learning HTML.  
I'll continue building better and more advanced pages as I grow.
